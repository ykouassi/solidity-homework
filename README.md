# ProfitSplitter Contracts
The Solidity exercise consists in creating contracts to do several things like:
- Pay your Associate-level employees quickly and easily.
- Distribute profits to different tiers of employees.
- Distribute company shares for employees in a "deferred equity incentive plan" automatically.
## Level One
 AssociateProfitSplitter.sol is a Solidity smart contract which consists in splitting evenly a specific amount of Ethereum among 3 parties. We were able to successfully deploy the contract.

 ## Level Two
TieredProfitSplitter.sol is a Solidity smart contract which consists in splitting amount of Ethereum among 3 parties according to the percentage given to each party. We were able to successfully deploy the contract. Details can be found here: https://ropsten.etherscan.io/tx/0x1b279deedc7fb6bd10488d1071a83006838be86124d6b2b707f5202575b02054

## Level Three
DeferredEquityPlan.sol is a Solidity smart contract which consists in storing deferred equity incentive on a Blockchain. We were able to successfully deploy the contract. Details can be found here: https://ropsten.etherscan.io/tx/0xac8762573d2f2f40701f3cac42627b223b87ab1c023813db8c5fa1dfaa1f2cb9
